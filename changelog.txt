RF models were updated!
- Bug fixed: cross-validation after application of extinction correction were being done in a different sample size than original. After fixing it by correcting extinction after the preprocess step, grid search values were changed (max depth is now 20)
- We uploaded the new .sav files into the RF folder
- Next steps are: re-run RF and merge catalogs again

Known issues up to this date:
- 6 fields fields failed to crossmatch; 12 failed to preprocess

Flow should be:

1) get_crossmatch.py
2) preprocess.py
3) get_predictions.py
4) merge_catalogs.py

These models should have been trained with extinction-corrected data.
We saw that we were not correcting WISE and GALEX (GALEX being the worst case...)

- BMDN: yes
- RF: yes
- FLEX: yes
